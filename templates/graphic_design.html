    I would like to think I am a little creative.
</p>
<p>
	I have done some graphic design with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/InDesign">Adobe InDesign</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/Photoshopâ€Ž">Adobe PhotoShop</a>. 
</p>
<p>
    You can check out some of my work here.

<h1> You can hire me for this, too! </h1>

<p>
    I'll freelance just about anything. Ask me to do it with a paycheck, and I can make it happen.
